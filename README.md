PiDraw - javascript geometry in your hands 
=============

PiMath is a script designed to create and generate geometrical illustration.
It is based above svg.js to display the graphics.

PiMath comes also with a *parser*, which is a "text to graphical illustration" application. 

This application is made for me and I'm glad to share it :)


Made with Love and LOTS of coffee :)
